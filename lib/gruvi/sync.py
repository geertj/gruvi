# A few words on the use of fiber locks (Lock) vs thread locks (threading.Lock)
# in the code below.
#
# There is no difference between both locks from a safety point of view. Both
# locks are thread-safe (which implies they are fiber-safe as well). The
# difference is who gets blocked when trying to acquire a lock that is already
# locked. With a fiber lock only the current fiber is blocked and other fibers
# in current thread can continue (and fibers in other threads as well, of
# course). With a thread lock the entire current thread is blocked including
# all its fibers.
#
# This means that if we never call hub.switch() when a lock is held, fiber and
# thread locks are completely identical. In this case there's a benefit in
# using thread locks because i) they are smaller and faster, and ii) it makes
# it possible for non-switchpoints to acquire the lock. An example of the
# latter case is Queue.put_nowait().
