TODO:

* Should we expose a Protocol.transport? If so the message handler signature
  can be simplied to handler(protocol, message) or handler(message, protocol)
* Fibers in the Fiber pool should be single shot.
* Futures should have a .cancel() method.
* Threads that exit without calling Hub.close() are not garbage collected. Not
  sure how this can be implemented. I think it is not possible without this
  Python RFE: http://bugs.python.org/issue14073
* Add a "trace id" around MessageProtocol.message_received() Or add it for a
  connection?
* http.parse_option_header() should ignore LWS. A better way to implement this
  function would be to use the parsing infrastructure from bluepass.parsing and
  then do a proper tokenization + parsing.
* gruvi.http needs better test coverage
* Add tests for JoinableQueue API
* Rename jsonrpc_ffi to json_ffi. Make json_splitter.c move analogous to
  http_parser.c using callbacks.
* util.py -> utils.py
* Implement Future.add_done_callback() and futures.wait()
* The Events returned by Protocol.connection_made() and Transport.start()
  should be Futures so that exceptions can be passed into the waiter.
* gruvi.Event is not complying with the threading API. It raises a Timeout on
  timeout rather than returning _flag.
* Futures should be thread safe, at least when used with a thread pool.

Things that could be done if they are useful:

* Graceful shutdown in Server: drain a protocol's queue.
* Missing synchronization primitives from asyncio: Semaphore, BoundedSemaphore.
